FASTER Cycling

Adaptive cycling training built for real life.

FASTER is designed for motivated cyclists who want structured progression toward a goal — without depending on perfect weeks.

Instead of following a rigid training calendar, FASTER builds your workouts dynamically around your goal and your training history. When you’re ready to train, you simply choose how much time you have available, and the app generates the right session instantly.

Whether your goal is increasing FTP, building endurance, preparing for a race, or becoming stronger overall, FASTER helps you progress with flexibility and structure combined.
